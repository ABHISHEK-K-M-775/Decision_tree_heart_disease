Project title : Decsison tree heart desease
>In this project we will train a decision tree ML model to predict if a person has heaert disease using some feautures

EDA:
>To do the analysis we have taken heart.csv dataset  from kagle
>it is a small dataset of 302 samples and 14 feautures along with target feautures
>we named the feautures and done visual inspection on data such as shape, datatypes, describen isnull
>we found no missing data but 2 columns had datatypes as object beacuse of missing values with filled as '?'
>since the samples containing missing values are less compared to total size of dataset we simply drop those columns 
>we also note that there are no outliers in numerical columns
